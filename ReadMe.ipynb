    "This project took a deep dive into the world of movies, analyzing large amounts information from tons of popular websites for movie reviews, like Rotten Tomatoes and TMDB. Our client, Microsoft, is looking to venture into the realm of movie production and our job is to analyze data in a way that helps them make a smart business decision. While cleaning and looking through all the data we had, it became important to define what a good or successful movie is. Using things like budget, revenue, profit, and popularity, we determined what a good movie suggestion would be for each style of directing.  "

    "Microsoft is opening a movie studio in response to competition's creation of video content. However, they are not well voiced in the realm of movie production so it is our job to analyze our data and create a suggestion for which genre of movie they should make. We used a variety of analyses to determine what the most important factors in movie success are. It is important to take into consideration how much the director is willing to spend and what level of risk they want to take. We wanted to answer the question of, \"What attributes make a movie successful?\". We went through the data and compared the movies we deemed successful, and compared their attributes to those of the movies that did not do well. By doing that analysis, we were able to come up with a metric that we can use to determine the success of a movie."

    "To compile our analysis, we used data collected from a couple of data frames that were given to us and from some that we found online. We used a TMDB data frame from kaggle.com that had information on over 10,000 movies that were made up to the year 2017. The datasets included characteristics of different movies like runtime, budgets, revenue, and critic & consumer ratings. We deemed these characteristics to be the most important when evaluating the success of a film. Although the datasets included a lot of information on a ton of different movies, some of the datasets were limited in that they had null values and/or placeholders in place for characteristics that were not recorded for older movies.

    "As we started to compile of our data and examine it, we realized that there was a lot more data than we needed to make our analysis. We decided to clean our data and get rid of the columns and rows that contained null values and placeholders and just columns with information that we just did not need. We also created columns that compared data from different columns to get a better sense of the data we were working with. For example, we created a profit column that took the difference between a movie's budget and its revenue. In the movie industry, there are movies in each genre that either did unusually well like Avatar or were unusually bad. These movies were outliers in our data sets that skewed our data so we created a line of code that calculated the z score and got rid of any movies that were 2 or more standard deviations away from the mean. Getting rid of the outliers was important because as a new movie producer, Microsoft does not necessarily need to aim to create record breaking, blockbuster films like Jurassic World and Star Wars in order to be successful.

    "To model our data, we used a combination of bar plots, line graphs, and boxplots. To come to our final suggestions, we looked at the data at different angles. The first angle we looked at was the average vote count and average vote score for each genre of movies in which we found using a bar plot to be the best method of visualization. Our next angle was looking at the average profit for each genre in relation to its initial budget. We used a variety of visualizations including line graphs, boxplots, and subplots to display the relationship for each of our top five genres. Additionally, ******Joe's data*"
